# CSCE629_algo_project: Maximum Bandwidth Path

Graph Algorithms
1. Random graph generation
2. Routing Algorithms

### Random Graph Generation
Create a dense graph and a sparse graph. All nodes should be connected.

### Routing Algorithms
1. Maximum-Bandwidth Path based on Dijkstra's algorithm without Heap Structure
2. Maximum-Bandwidth Path based on Dijkstra's algorithm with Heap Structure
3. Maximum-Bandwidth Path based on Kruskal's algorithms using HeapSort
